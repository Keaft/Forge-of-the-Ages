***Before Updating ensure that you take a backup of your world!***

Configuration changes:
- Removed Thaumcraft quicksilver drop from the ore dictionary list.
- Fixed InvMove disabling the GUI from Waystones.
- Adjusted InvMove to move only in appropriate times.
- Melded together the functionality of Inventory Tweaks and Quark.
-- Inventory Tweaks throw stack from inventory now only works with the right alt and not the left. This is due to Quark's favoriting system requiring the left alt key.
- Disabled Quark Trash Can in favor of the FTB Utilities one.
- Environmental Tech now prefers Metallurgy ores.
- Tinkers Construct now prefers Metallurgy for pours.
- Pyrotheum now properly added as a smeltery fuel.
- Right Click for Pam's Harvestcraft re-enabled. (Might have conflicts with xp from harvest)
- Regenerated and configured the Scape and Run: Parasites config.
- Disabled the fear effect from SR:Parasites from panicking, because no... I'm not panicking until I have the fear effect.
- Mystical Agriculture now never drops a second seed on harvest. It's a methodical, but the farm upgrade process is meant to be a chill experience. Those familiar with machines can make the process more automated for a more set and forget experience.
