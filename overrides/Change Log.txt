This update is mostly Adventure focused! It also addresses a little more of the necessity for transition from casual minecraft player into modded minecraft player. This is done through a little more farming/fishing emphasis building slightly on the vanilla experience.

Configuration changes:
- Removed configuration for Rats from In Control! and CraftTweaker.
- Attempted to make Trumpet Skeletons rarer... Again... Doot Doot.
- Removed recipe changes involving Minecolonies.
- Fixed Ore dictionary for Amethysts so they go to the correct type now.
- Adjusted mummies in the desert to spawn more neatly in the night.
- Fixed loot drop for silver fish.
- Made Sea Serpents spawn more frequently, but only at night. (Keep in mind they appear far away from spawn!)
- Reduced the spawning of Gorgon Temples. Hopefully...
- Changed configs to ensure that Xp From Harvest handles replant with right click.
- Disabled and removed some duplicate enchantments.
- Made getting the most rudimentary applied energetics system easier to obtain. Start with that drawer controller and some drawers!
- Cleaned up some CraftTweaker scripts.
- Changed /Dank/Null to be a progression system.
- Made Scaling Health an optional difficulty increase through recipes.
- Made Ardite and Cobalt into stone varieties and ensured they work in furnaces and such.
- Made Ardite and Cobalt generate in the beneath.
- Added Ardite and Cobalt to Scannable under the rare category.
- Battle Towers disabled in The Twilight Forest and Aether.
- Battle Towers disabled in the Oceans.
- Added recipe for basic Firework Rockets in JEI. Fireworks can still be complicated and customizable, but it's difficult to show recipes for that customization. Refer to a minecraft wiki if you want specialized rockets.
- Removed furnace recipe for flux. Back to creating interesting machines to automate throwing into fire/lava!
- Re-introduced Extra Utilities 2 Pipe system, but only for fluids.
- Made Infinite lava sources just like water. Now you can pump to your hearts desire!
- Changed recipe and skill requirement for some of Extra Utilities flight rings.
- Removed extraneous flight items that served no purpose.
- Separated Ender IO into it's modular form to remove the Inventory System in favor of Applied Energistics 2.
- Removed the Dislocator Pedestal from Draconic Evolution.
- Added Tinkers Tools and Armor to encourage Fishing.
- Added content and changed recipes for the slime slings.
- With the removal of Elder Spider Guardians drops have moved to Sea Serpents.
- Lowered the spawn rate of Shadows in the beneath for reasons.
- Changed fluid spawning in the beneath.
- Added trees to the beneath.
- Removed gravel from the beneath to help with performance.
- Hopefully moved cave spawning through worley's caves lower from the surface.
- Now utilizing a craft tweaker to unify materials.
- Created duplicate content for aquaculture to enable it to work nicely with Project MMO.
- Totems of undying only spawn from Evokers if it's a player kill.
- Disabled Ender Tweaker script. Ender Tweaker loads ok without script, but is otherwise incompatible with newest Ender IO.
